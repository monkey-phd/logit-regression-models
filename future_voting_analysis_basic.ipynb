    "1. **Setting up the Database Connection**:\n",
    "   - We're using the SQLAlchemy library to set up a connection to the MySQL database. The `create_engine` function constructs a new connection to the specified database.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "engine = create_engine(\"mysql+pymysql://root:password@localhost/snapshot_database\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Retrieval**:\n",
    "   - We retrieve the data from two tables: `votes` and `proposals`, and store them in pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "votes = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM votes', con=engine)\n",
    "proposals = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM proposals', con=engine)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Merging Data**:\n",
    "   - We merge the two DataFrames on the `proposal` column from the `votes` table and the `id` column from the `proposals` table. This gives us a combined dataset with all the information we need.\n",
    "\n",

    "4. **Filtering Data for Basic Voting**:\n",
    "   - We filter our merged dataset to only consider rows where the voting type is \"basic\".\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "votes_basic = votes_proposals[votes_proposals['type'] == 'basic'].copy()\n",

    "6. **Alignment Check**:\n",
    "   - We then check if each individual vote aligns with the winning choice for its respective proposal.\n",

    "votes_basic['aligned'] = (votes_basic['choice'] == votes_basic['winning_choice']).astype(int)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Previous Alignment**:\n",
    "   - We create a lag variable to check the alignment of a voter's previous vote in the same DAO. This will help us understand if a misalignment in a voter's previous vote impacts their future voting behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "votes_basic['previous_aligned'] = votes_basic.groupby(['voter', 'space_vote'])['aligned'].shift()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Misalignment Check**:\n",
    "   - We generate a binary column to indicate if the previous vote was misaligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "votes_basic['misaligned_previous'] = (votes_basic['previous_aligned'] == 0).astype(int)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Future Voting Indicator**:\n",
    "   - We determine if a voter participated in a subsequent proposal within the same DAO.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "votes_basic['future_voting'] = votes_basic.groupby(['voter', 'space_vote'])['choice'].shift(-1).notna().astype(int)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Regression Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Finally, we conduct a logistic regression analysis to understand the relationship between misalignment in a voter's previous vote and their likelihood to participate in future voting.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "X = votes_basic[['misaligned_previous']]\n",
    "X = sm.add_constant(X)  # Adds a constant term to the predictor\n",
    "y = votes_basic['future_voting']\n",
    "\n",
    "model = sm.Logit(y, X)\n",
    "result = model.fit()\n",
    "print(result.summary())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code provides a comprehensive analysis of the \"basic\" voting type, exploring whether voters who were misaligned in a previous vote are less likely to participate in future votes."

    "**1. Model Overview:**\n",
    "- **Dep. Variable**: `future_voting` - This is our dependent variable. It indicates whether a voter participated in a subsequent proposal within the same DAO.\n",
    "- **No. Observations**: 350,294 - This is the number of votes that were analyzed.\n",
    "- **Pseudo R-squ**: 0.1406 - This value indicates the goodness-of-fit of the model. It's an alternative to the R-squared used in linear regression, specifically for logistic regression. A higher pseudo R-squared indicates a better fit, but interpretation can be complex and should be done with caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Coefficient Interpretation:**\n",
    "- **const (Intercept) coefficient**: -0.3629 - This is the log odds of a voter participating in a subsequent proposal when the `misaligned_previous` is 0 (i.e., when the previous vote was aligned). It's a baseline measure.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **misaligned_previous coefficient**: 1.9626 - This is the change in log odds associated with a misaligned previous vote. Since the coefficient is positive, it suggests that if a voter's previous vote was misaligned, the log odds of them voting in a subsequent proposal are higher by approximately 1.9626 units compared to when their previous vote was aligned. This is counterintuitive but might be due to various reasons, such as increased engagement after a misaligned vote.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Statistical Significance:**\n",
    "- The p-values for both the intercept and the `misaligned_previous` are very close to 0, indicating that the results are statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Odds Ratio Interpretation (not shown in the output but can be calculated):**\n",
    "- The odds ratio for the `misaligned_previous` can be found by exponentiating its coefficient. This will give you the multiplicative change in the odds for a 1-unit change in the predictor. An odds ratio greater than 1 suggests that as the predictor increases, the odds of the outcome occurring also increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these results, it appears that voters who had a misaligned vote in the past are more likely to participate in future votes within the same DAO. However, the reasons behind this could be manifold and may require further qualitative research or exploration to fully understand."
