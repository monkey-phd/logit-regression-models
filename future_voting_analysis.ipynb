    "### 1. Database Connection:\n",
    "\n",
    "This section of the code establishes a connection to a MySQL database in order to fetch and manipulate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database Connection String:** \n",
    "```python\n",
    "engine = create_engine(\"mysql+pymysql://root:password@localhost/snapshot_database\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "This line creates a connection to a MySQL database using the `pymysql` driver. The username is `root`, password is `password`, host is `localhost`, and the database name is `snapshot_database`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Retrieval:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, data is fetched from the database tables into pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fetching the `votes` Table:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "votes = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM votes', con=engine)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This line fetches all rows and columns from the `votes` table in the database and stores them in the `votes` DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fetching the `proposals` Table:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "proposals = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM proposals', con=engine)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Similarly, this line fetches all data from the `proposals` table and stores it in the `proposals` DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Merging:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `votes` and `proposals` DataFrames are merged based on common columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Merging on `proposal` and `id`:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "votes_proposals = votes.merge(proposals, left_on='proposal', right_on='id', suffixes=('_vote', '_proposal'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `merge()` function combines the `votes` DataFrame with the `proposals` DataFrame. The merging is done based on the `proposal` column from `votes` and the `id` column from `proposals`. If there are columns with the same names in both DataFrames, the suffixes `'_vote'` and `'_proposal'` are added to differentiate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Displaying Merged Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "The merged data is printed to the console for a quick overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Printing the Merged Data:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(votes_proposals)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This line displays the combined data of `votes` and `proposals` in the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Cleanup:\n",
    "\n",
    "After all operations with the database are completed, it's important to close the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Closing the Database Connection:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "engine.dispose()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This line closes the connection to the MySQL database, ensuring efficient resource utilization and preventing potential issues with prolonged open connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the provided code sets up a connection to a MySQL database, fetches data from two specific tables, merges this data based on common columns, displays the merged data, and then closes the database connection."

    "\n",
    "**Dependent Variable (Y) - `future_voting`:** \n",
    "This variable captures whether a voter will participate in a subsequent proposal within the same DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). A value of `1` means the voter participated in a subsequent proposal, and `0` means they didn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Independent Variable (X) - `misaligned_previous`:** \n",
    "This variable captures whether a voter's previous vote was misaligned with the winning choice of a proposal. A value of `1` indicates the voter's choice in the previous proposal was misaligned with the winning choice, and `0` means it was aligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Computation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. Determining the winning choice:**\n",
    "We first identified the winning choice for each proposal by looking at the `scores` column. The winning choice is the choice with the highest score. We computed it using:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "votes_single_choice['winning_choice'] = votes_single_choice['scores'].apply(lambda x: x.index(max(x)) + 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Determining alignment:**\n",
    "We then determined if each vote was aligned with the winning choice by comparing the voter's `choice` with the `winning_choice` for each proposal. This is computed using:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "votes_single_choice['aligned'] = (votes_single_choice['choice'] == votes_single_choice['winning_choice']).astype(int)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**c. Creating a lag variable for previous alignment:**\n",
    "To capture a voter's alignment in the previous proposal, we used the `shift()` function. This function allows us to access the previous row's data for each voter within each DAO (`space_vote`). We computed it using:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "votes_single_choice['previous_aligned'] = votes_single_choice.groupby(['voter', 'space_vote'])['aligned'].shift()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**d. Identifying misaligned previous votes:**\n",
    "Based on the `previous_aligned` column, we determined if the previous vote was misaligned (value of `0`). We computed it using:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "votes_single_choice['misaligned_previous'] = (votes_single_choice['previous_aligned'] == 0).astype(int)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**e. Identifying future voting behavior:**\n",
    "To determine if a voter participated in a subsequent proposal within the same DAO, we used the `shift(-1)` function. This function lets us access the next row's data for each voter within each DAO. If a voter has data in the next row (indicating they voted in a subsequent proposal), the column value is `1`; otherwise, it's `0`. We computed it using:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "votes_single_choice['future_voting'] = votes_single_choice.groupby(['voter', 'space_vote'])['choice'].shift(-1).notna().astype(int)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we used the computed `misaligned_previous` as our independent variable \\( X \\) and `future_voting` as our dependent variable \\( Y \\) to run a logistic regression. The regression was set up to examine the relationship between having a previous misaligned vote and the likelihood of voting in a subsequent proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic regression model was built using the statsmodels library, and the results provide coefficients that describe the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the model and computations aim to answer the research question: \"How does a misaligned vote in a decentralized decision-making process affect an individual's likelihood to participate in future decision-making within the same DAO?\""
