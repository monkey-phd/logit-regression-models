    "import statsmodels.api as sm\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "- `json`: Used to parse and manipulate JSON formatted data.\n",
    "- `sqlalchemy`: Allows SQL-based database connections.\n",
    "- `statsmodels`: Provides classes and functions for statistical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Establish Database Connection**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "engine = create_engine(\"mysql+pymysql://root:password@localhost/snapshot_database\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This line creates a connection to the MySQL database. Adjust the connection string if necessary.\n",

    "```\n",
    "- Fetches the `votes` and `proposals` tables from the database.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "votes_proposals = votes.merge(proposals, left_on='proposal', right_on='id', suffixes=('_vote', '_proposal'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This merges the `votes` and `proposals` data on the proposal ID.\n",

    "```\n",
    "- Marks a vote as aligned (`1`) if the voter's choice includes the winning choice, otherwise marks it as not aligned (`0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Lag Variable for Previous Alignment**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "votes_approval['previous_aligned'] = votes_approval.groupby(['voter', 'space_vote'])['aligned'].shift()\n",
    "```\n",
    "- For each voter and DAO, checks if the previous vote was aligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Mark Misaligned Previous Votes**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "votes_approval['misaligned_previous'] = (votes_approval['previous_aligned'] == 0).astype(int)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- If the previous vote was not aligned, it is marked as misaligned.\n",

    "1. **Dep. Variable: `future_voting`**\n",
    "   - This is the dependent variable you're trying to predict. It indicates whether a voter will vote in a future proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model: `Logit`**\n",
    "   - This indicates that a logistic regression model was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pseudo R-squ.: `0.01781`**\n",
    "   - The Pseudo R-squared value provides a measure of goodness of fit for logistic regression models. In general, a higher value indicates a better fit, but this metric does not have the same interpretation as the R-squared in linear regression. The value you have (about 1.78%) suggests that the model explains a small portion of the variance in the dependent variable. However, in many applications with real-world data, especially in social sciences, even small R-squared values can be meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Log-Likelihood: `-44303.`**\n",
    "   - This is the log-likelihood of the model, a measure of fit. The higher the log-likelihood, the better the model fits the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **LL-Null: `-45106.`**\n",
    "   - This is the log-likelihood of a model with no predictors, just an intercept. It serves as a comparison to the log-likelihood of the current model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **LLR p-value: `0.000`**\n",
    "   - This is the p-value for the likelihood ratio test comparing the fit of the current model against the null model. A small p-value (typically < 0.05) indicates that your model fits the data better than a model with no predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Coefficient Table**\n",
    "   - `const`: This is the intercept. Its coefficient value of `-2.5817` can be interpreted in the log-odds scale. In logistic regression, the intercept is the log-odds of the dependent variable occurring when all predictors are 0.\n",
    "   - `misaligned_previous`: The coefficient value of `1.4936` indicates the change in the log-odds of `future_voting` for a one-unit change in `misaligned_previous`. Since `misaligned_previous` is binary, this coefficient tells us that the log-odds of voting in the future are about 1.49 times higher for those who had a misaligned vote previously, compared to those who didn't.\n",
    "   - The `z` values provide a test of the hypothesis that each coefficient is different from 0. A large absolute value of z indicates that you can reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "   - The `P>|z|` values test the hypothesis that each coefficient is different from 0. Small p-values (< 0.05) indicate that you can reject the null hypothesis. In this case, both predictors are significant.\n",
    "   - The `[0.025 0.975]` values are the 95% confidence intervals for the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway**: \n",
    "The results suggest that having a misaligned vote in the past is a significant predictor for future voting behavior. Specifically, those who previously voted in a way that was not aligned with the majority are more likely to vote in future proposals compared to those who didn't have a misaligned vote. This provides valuable insights into voting behavior in the context of \"Approval\" voting type."
