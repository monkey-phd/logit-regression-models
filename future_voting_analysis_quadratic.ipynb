    "## Analyzing Quadratic Voting Patterns in Proposals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up the Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import json\n",
    "from sqlalchemy import create_engine\n",
    "import statsmodels.api as sm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by importing necessary libraries. `pandas` for data manipulation, `json` for parsing JSON formatted strings, `sqlalchemy` for database connections, and `statsmodels` for regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connecting to the Database\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "engine = create_engine(\"mysql+pymysql://root:password@localhost/snapshot_database\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using SQLAlchemy, an engine is created to connect to the `snapshot_database` MySQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieving Data\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "votes = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM votes', con=engine)\n",
    "proposals = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM proposals', con=engine)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The votes and proposals tables from the database are loaded into pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Merging Data\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "votes_proposals = votes.merge(proposals, left_on='proposal', right_on='id', suffixes=('_vote', '_proposal'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Votes and proposals are merged on their respective IDs, with suffixes added to differentiate columns that have the same name in both tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filtering for Quadratic Voting\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "votes_quadratic = votes_proposals[votes_proposals['type'] == 'quadratic'].copy()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We filter for entries where the type of voting is 'quadratic'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining the Quadratic Winning Choice Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `get_quadratic_winning_choice` function calculates the winning choice for a given set of votes, considering the weights associated with each choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the choice is provided as a dictionary, it takes the square root of each weight and aggregates them.\n",
    "- If the choice is given as a list, it assumes a weight of 1 for each item in the list.\n",
    "- Any decoding errors or unexpected data formats are printed for debugging purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying the Function\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "winning_choices_quadratic = votes_quadratic.groupby('id_proposal').apply(lambda group: get_quadratic_winning_choice(group['choice'].tolist(), group['scores'].tolist()))\n",
    "votes_quadratic['winning_choice_updated'] = votes_quadratic['id_proposal'].map(winning_choices_quadratic)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For each proposal, the function is applied to find the winning choice. This winning choice is then added as a new column in the `votes_quadratic` DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine if a user's vote was aligned with the winning choice.\n",
    "2. Check if the user's previous vote was aligned.\n",
    "3. Check if the user voted in a subsequent proposal within the same DAO.\n",
    "4. Run a logistic regression to see if users who misaligned their previous vote are less likely to vote in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "X = votes_quadratic[['misaligned_previous']]\n",
    "X = sm.add_constant(X)  \n",
    "y = votes_quadratic['future_voting']\n",
    "\n",
    "model = sm.Logit(y, X)\n",
    "result = model.fit()\n",
    "print(result.summary())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A logistic regression model is fit to predict the likelihood of a user voting in a subsequent proposal based on whether their previous vote was misaligned with the winning choice. The results are printed, providing coefficients, p-values, and other statistics."

    "## Logistic Regression Analysis on Future Voting Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dependent Variable (DV)**: `future_voting`\n",
    "    - This is what you're trying to predict. It seems to be a binary variable indicating whether a voter voted in a subsequent proposal (1 for Yes, 0 for No).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Independent Variable (IV)**: `misaligned_previous`\n",
    "    - This is your predictor or explanatory variable. It appears to be a binary variable indicating whether a voter's previous vote was misaligned with the winning choice (1 for misaligned, 0 for aligned).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pseudo R-squared**: 0.008228\n",
    "    - This value indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that's explained by the independent variables. In logistic regression, this isn't interpreted in the same way as the R-squared in linear regression. It's a low value, suggesting that the model explains a small portion of the variance in future voting behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Log-Likelihood**: -25330\n",
    "    - This is the log of the likelihood function value for the estimated model. It's used for model comparison. A model with a higher log-likelihood is preferred to a model with a lower one.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **LL-Null**: -25540\n",
    "    - This is the log-likelihood of a model with no predictors, i.e., only an intercept. It serves as a baseline against which the log-likelihood of the estimated model is compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **LLR p-value**: 2.135e-93\n",
    "    - This is the p-value for the likelihood ratio test comparing the fit of the model with predictors to the fit of the model with only an intercept. The very small p-value suggests that your model with the predictor `misaligned_previous` fits significantly better than a model with no predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **const (Intercept)**:\n",
    "    - Coefficient: 0.1247\n",
    "    - This is the log odds of voting in a subsequent proposal for someone whose previous vote was aligned (since `misaligned_previous` is 0 for them).\n",
    "    - The positive coefficient suggests that, on average, there's a positive log odds of voting in a subsequent proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **misaligned_previous**:\n",
    "    - Coefficient: 0.6632\n",
    "    - This coefficient represents the change in the log odds of voting in a subsequent proposal for someone whose previous vote was misaligned compared to someone whose vote was aligned.\n",
    "    - The positive coefficient suggests that individuals who had a misaligned vote in the past have higher log odds of voting in a subsequent proposal compared to those who had aligned votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both coefficients are statistically significant (p < 0.05), suggesting that both the intercept and the effect of having a misaligned vote in the past are different from zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the regression results suggest that having a misaligned vote in the past is associated with a higher likelihood of voting in a subsequent proposal."
