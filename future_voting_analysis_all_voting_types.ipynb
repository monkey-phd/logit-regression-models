    "from sqlalchemy import create_engine\n",
    "import statsmodels.api as sm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This section imports the necessary libraries:\n",
    "- `pandas` for data manipulation.\n",
    "- `json` for handling JSON data within the voting choices.\n",
    "- `sqlalchemy` for connecting to and querying the MySQL database.\n",
    "- `statsmodels.api` for regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Database Connection**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "engine = create_engine(\"mysql+pymysql://root:password@localhost/snapshot_database\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This sets up a connection to the MySQL database. Replace the connection string with appropriate credentials if they change.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Data Retrieval**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "votes = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM votes', con=engine)\n",
    "proposals = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM proposals', con=engine)\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Voting System Implementations**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are six functions, each corresponding to a different voting system:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Single Choice Voting**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def single_choice_voting(data):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "For each proposal, it determines the winning choice based on the highest score. Then, it checks if each voter's choice aligns with the winning choice. It also prepares the data for regression analysis to understand the behavior of voters based on their alignment with the winning choice in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **Weighted Voting**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def weighted_voting(data):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this system, each choice has an associated weight. The function determines the winning choice based on the sum of weights. Similar to the single choice voting, it prepares the data for regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. **Approval Voting**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def approval_voting(data):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "Voters can approve multiple choices. The choice with the most approvals wins. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### d. **Quadratic Voting**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def quadratic_voting(data):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "Voters allocate a set number of votes among choices, but the cost of giving multiple votes to a choice is quadratic. The function determines the winning choice based on the quadratic weight of votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### e. **Ranked Choice Voting**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def ranked_choice_voting(data):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "Voters rank their preferences. If no choice gets a majority of first-preference votes, the least popular choice is eliminated, and its votes are reallocated based on the next preference. This process repeats until a choice gains a majority.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### f. **Basic Voting**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def basic_voting(data):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "It's similar to single-choice voting but might be tailored for a more fundamental voting system.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Analysis Execution**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "voting_types = ['single-choice', 'weighted', 'approval', 'quadratic', 'ranked-choice', 'basic']\n",
    "analysis_functions = [single_choice_voting, weighted_voting, approval_voting, quadratic_voting, ranked_choice_voting, basic_voting]\n",
    "results = {}\n",
    "\n",
    "for vote_type, func in zip(voting_types, analysis_functions):\n",
    "    filtered_votes = votes_proposals[votes_proposals['type'] == vote_type].copy()\n",
    "    print(f\"\\nProcessing {vote_type} voting analysis...\\n\")\n",
    "    results[vote_type] = func(filtered_votes)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterates over each voting system, filters the data for that system, and applies the corresponding analysis function.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Result Display**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for vote_type, result in results.items():\n",
    "    print(f\"\\nResults for {vote_type} voting:\")\n",
    "    print(result.summary())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Prints the regression results for each voting system. The regression analysis checks if a voter's misalignment with the winning choice in a past vote impacts their likelihood to vote in future proposals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This code provides a comprehensive analysis of different voting systems and the behavior of voters in each system. It can help understand which system aligns most with the voters' preferences and if voters are discouraged from participating in future votes when their choice doesn't win."

    "The provided results are from logistic regression models that aim to understand the effect of misaligned voting on future participation in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). The primary research question here is: \"How does the outcome of decentralized decision-making affect individual participation in autonomous organizations?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Interpretation of the Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dependent Variable:** This is `future_voting`, which indicates whether a voter participated in subsequent proposals within the same DAO (1 for participation, 0 otherwise).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Independent Variable:** The key independent variable is `misaligned_previous`, which indicates whether a voter's choice in the previous proposal was not aligned with the winning choice (1 for misalignment, 0 otherwise).\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly! Let's break this down:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **H1: Effect of Past Decision Outcome on Participation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying hypothesis, H1, suggests that if past decisions favor an individual, they're more likely to participate in future DAO proposals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single-Choice Voting:** Voters who were against the majority in past decisions are more likely to vote in the future. This contradicts H1.\n",
    "- **Weighted Voting:** The trend continues, again going against H1.\n",
    "- **Approval Voting:** The pattern persists, further opposing H1.\n",
    "- **Quadratic Voting:** Here too, the data contradicts H1.\n",
    "- **Ranked-Choice Voting:** This is the only system supporting H1, indicating voters whose choices didn't win previously are less likely to participate again.\n",
    "- **Basic Voting:** Once more, the result goes against H1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion for H1:** Except for ranked-choice voting, all systems suggest that voters are more inclined to participate in future votes when their past decisions didn't align with the majority. This opposes H1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **H2: Complexity of Voting Systems and Participation**\n",
    "\n",
    "H2 hypothesizes that participation increases with the complexity of voting systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "For clarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complex Systems:** These include Weighted, Quadratic, Approval, and Ranked-Choice.\n",
    "- **Simple Systems:** These encompass Single-Choice and Basic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weighted Voting:** A complex system, this shows a strong inclination for future participation after a misaligned vote.\n",
    "- **Quadratic Voting:** Another complex system, the inclination here is less pronounced than in weighted voting.\n",
    "- **Approval Voting:** Represents a moderate inclination towards future participation.\n",
    "- **Ranked-Choice Voting:** Interestingly, this complex system demonstrates a reduced likelihood of future participation after a misaligned vote.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing to simpler systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single-Choice Voting:** Shows a strong inclination for future participation.\n",
    "- **Basic Voting:** Exhibits an even stronger inclination.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion for H2:** The complexity of the voting system doesn't consistently correlate with higher participation. While systems like weighted voting indicate increased participation, others, such as ranked-choice, show the opposite. Similarly, some simpler systems, like basic voting, indicate extremely high future participation. Thus, voting system complexity isn't a sole determinant of participation, and other intrinsic factors related to each system might influence voter behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the impact of past decision outcomes on future participation varies across voting systems, and the complexity of a voting system doesn't consistently correlate with increased participation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Implications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **For H1: Effect of Past Decision Outcome on Participation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Voter Engagement:** The findings for most voting systems suggest that when voters experience a loss or misalignment, they are more inclined to participate in future votes. This could be seen as a form of resilience or a renewed motivation to influence subsequent decisions. DAOs should acknowledge this behavior and can even leverage it to foster continuous engagement within their communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ranked-Choice Voting Exception:** The unique behavior observed in ranked-choice voting, where misaligned voters are less likely to participate in future votes, raises questions about the system's dynamics. It's possible that voters feel their preferences are somewhat represented, even if their top choice doesn't win, given the ranking mechanism. Alternatively, the system's complexity might be discouraging repeat participation. DAOs using this system should consider additional measures to encourage sustained voter engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **For H2: Complexity of Voting Systems and Participation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complexity Isn't Always Better:** While it might be tempting to assume that more intricate voting systems ensure higher participation, the findings challenge this notion. Some complex systems, like ranked-choice voting, even showed decreased participation. DAOs should be wary of implementing overly complex systems without considering other factors like user education, interface design, and community feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Experience Matters:** Simpler systems, especially basic voting, showed high levels of participation. This could be attributed to the straightforward nature of these systems, making them more accessible and understandable for voters. DAOs should weigh the benefits of a system's sophistication against its ease of use and accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feedback and Education:** Given the varied responses across systems, DAOs should prioritize gathering feedback from their communities about their voting experiences. Additionally, offering educational resources about the intricacies of each system can help voters make informed decisions and feel more confident in their participation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while the effect of past decision outcomes and system complexity does influence future participation, it's essential for DAOs to consider these in tandem with other factors like user experience, community feedback, and educational support. The goal should always be to adopt a system that best serves the community's needs and encourages sustained engagement."
