    "**Analysis of Ranked-Choice Voting Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Import Necessary Libraries:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import json\n",
    "from sqlalchemy import create_engine\n",
    "import statsmodels.api as sm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** We begin by importing the necessary libraries. `pandas` is used for data manipulation, `json` for parsing JSON strings, `sqlalchemy` to connect to the database, and `statsmodels` for regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Establishing Database Connection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "engine = create_engine(\"mysql+pymysql://root:password@localhost/snapshot_database\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** We create a connection to the MySQL database using `create_engine`. Adjust the connection string (`\"mysql+pymysql://root:password@localhost/snapshot_database\"`) to your specific database credentials and name.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Reading Data from the Database:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "votes = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM votes', con=engine)\n",
    "proposals = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM proposals', con=engine)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** We read the tables `votes` and `proposals` from the database into two separate pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Merging Tables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "votes_proposals = votes.merge(proposals, left_on='proposal', right_on='id', suffixes=('_vote', '_proposal'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** We merge the `votes` and `proposals` tables based on the proposal IDs. If columns have the same name in both tables, we append the suffixes `_vote` and `_proposal` to distinguish them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Filtering Data for Ranked-Choice Voting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "votes_ranked = votes_proposals[votes_proposals['type'] == 'ranked-choice'].copy()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** We filter the data to retain only the rows where the voting type is 'ranked-choice'.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Ranked-Choice Voting Calculation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def ranked_choice_voting(choices_list):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** This function implements the ranked-choice voting mechanism. It counts the first choices and checks if any choice has more than 50% of the votes. If not, it eliminates the least popular choice and redistributes its votes to the next available choices of those voters. The process continues iteratively until a choice has the majority of votes or all choices have been considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Identifying Winning Choices:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "winning_choices_ranked = votes_ranked.groupby('id_proposal').apply(lambda group: ranked_choice_voting(group['choice'].tolist()))\n",
    "votes_ranked['winning_choice'] = votes_ranked['id_proposal'].map(winning_choices_ranked)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** For each proposal, we apply the `ranked_choice_voting` function to determine the winning choice. The winning choices are then mapped back to the main DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Vote Alignment Calculation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "votes_ranked['aligned'] = votes_ranked.apply(lambda row: 1 if row['winning_choice'] in json.loads(row['choice'].replace(\"'\", \"\\\"\")) else 0, axis=1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** For each vote, we check if the winning choice is present in the voter's ranked choices. If it is, the vote is considered aligned (`1`), otherwise it's not aligned (`0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Creating Lag Variables and Future Voting Indicator:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "votes_ranked['previous_aligned'] = votes_ranked.groupby(['voter', 'space_vote'])['aligned'].shift()\n",
    "votes_ranked['misaligned_previous'] = (votes_ranked['previous_aligned'] == 0).astype(int)\n",
    "votes_ranked['future_voting'] = votes_ranked.groupby(['voter', 'space_vote'])['choice'].shift(-1).notna().astype(int)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** We create a lag variable to check if a voter's previous vote was aligned. We then create an indicator for whether the voter's previous vote was misaligned. Lastly, we create an indicator for whether the voter voted in a subsequent proposal within the same DAO.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. Regression Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "X = votes_ranked[['misaligned_previous']]\n",
    "X = sm.add_constant(X)\n",
    "y = votes_ranked['future_voting']\n",
    "\n",
    "model = sm.Logit(y, X)\n",
    "result = model.fit()\n",
    "print(result.summary())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** We conduct a regression analysis to examine the relationship between whether a voter's previous vote was misaligned and their likelihood of voting in a future proposal. The results provide coefficients and statistical tests that can be used to interpret this relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis allows us to understand how voters behave in a ranked-choice voting system and whether their past voting patterns influence their future voting decisions."
